        <p><a href="./202402040346.html">Agile Software Development </a> is praised for its short duty cycles and fast, steady progress. Why can't hardware development be done in the same way?</p>
        <p>Put simply, it costs more to "deploy" (design, build, test, and manufacture at scale) hardware.<br />
        Each hardware iteration can cost thousands or millions of dollars. For this reason, it is more cost-effective to iterate more slowly: perform rigorous analysis, make more design decisions per iteration, etc..</p>
        <p>For this reason, hardware development is typically done with a more "waterfall" project management approach. Since more is at stake if a mistake is made (or a requirement changes), more resources are devoted to communicating with the customer, budget, schedule, design, analysis, test, risk identification/mitigation, etc.</p>
