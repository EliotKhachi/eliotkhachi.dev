        <p><strong>Lazy Loading / Cache-Aside / Lazy Population</strong> - Caches <em>all</em> requested data, that is requested at <em>any</em> point. Think Cloudfront. <em>Cache is only filled with used data. Cache misses cause increased latency. Data in cache may be old</em></p>
        <p><strong>WriteThrough</strong> - Add or update cache when database is updated. <em>Cache is never stale but may store a lot of never-read data; reads are quick but we have a write penalty.</em><br />
        <strong>Cache Evictions</strong> - 1) explicit deletion of items in the cache, 2) when the cache memory is full, you delete items based on how recently they were used, or 3) you set a time-to-live (TTL) for the cache items (ranges from a few seconds to days).</p>
        <p>All 3 of these caching design patterns can be combined for certain types of data, except you don't want to combine TTL with WriteThrough.</p>
