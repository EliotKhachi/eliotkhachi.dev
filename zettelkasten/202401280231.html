        <p>The GNU General Public (GPL) License is more strict than the <a href="./202401280229.html">MIT License</a>.</p>
        <p>When applied to a set of files and/or documentation files (the "Software"), the GPL license 1) states that this Software doesn't come with any warranty and 2) grants any person rights to use, copy, modify and/or distribute it under the following conditions:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Any distributors must make the Software, or any modified version thereof, and any additions or combinations to said Software, available under the same licensing terms.</li>
        <li>Distributors must make the Software, or any modified version thereof, and any additions or combinations to said Software, open-source.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With that being said, there are ways to avoid open-sourcing your proprietary software while taking advantage of GPL-licensed software. For example, instead of compiling your code into a single executable before runtime (thereby compiling/linking the GPL-license code to produce a combined work, i.e. the resulting executable), you can link your proprietary software with GPL-licensed libraries <em>during</em> runtime (dynamic linking) by having your executable reference dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). Distributors of such dual-licensed software must still provide access to the GPL-licensed library's source code, among other requirements.</p>
