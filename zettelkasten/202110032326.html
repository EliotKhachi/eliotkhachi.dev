        <p>Implementing <a href="./202110052023.html">Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)</a> is just as much of an organizational change initiative as it is a software adoption initiative because it's all about how you represent knowledge within the organization and facilitate information flow. All relevant persons must agree to use it.</p>
        <p>Begin by defining your purpose for implementing a Model-Based approach. In other words, don't try to "boil the ocean". Simplify and implement one feature at a time.</p>
