        <p>The 3 pillars of <a href="./202110052023.html">Model-Based Systems Engineering</a> are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Modeling Language - Rules used to define the model [<a href="./202110032315.html">What is SysML? </a>]</li>
        <li>Modeling Methods - Roadmap of design tasks for a team to build the model consistently towards a common end point. <a href="./202110032326.html">Implementing a Model-Based Enterprise </a></li>
        <li>Modeling Tools - Software designed to implement and enforce the rules of the modeling language, and reduce friction in performing the modeling methods.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All 3 pillars are needed to make a good model of a system. Whether or not that system is <em>well-designed</em> is outside the scope of MBSE.</p>
