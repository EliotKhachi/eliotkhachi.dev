        <li>A "model" is a digital representation of a system [<a href="./202110032156.html">What is a System</a>]. In the backend, the model is stored in a NoSQL database.</li>
        <li>The model is not shown all at once. Rather, there are various "views" of the model. Each view is textually encoded as an XML/JSON/SysML file, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_diagram">block-diagram-like</a> graphical representation. The graphical and textual representations of SysML are much more expressive than block diagrams [<a href="./202110032315.html">What is SysML?</a>].</li>
