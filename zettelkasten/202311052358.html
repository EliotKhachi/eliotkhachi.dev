        <p>I've done <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> problems in the past, but I thought I'd document my journey and have a more structured approach to solving them.</p>
        <p>I believe every programmer should solve the <a href="https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/">Blind 75 Must Do Leetcode</a> problems on their own at least once. Viewing the solutions is fine and there is no need to get too hung up on mastering them. The point of this exercise is to learn the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorthims and accumulate some intuition for designing complex algorithms.</p>
        <p>Aside from that, I think this is going to be a fun journey ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>
        <p>P.S. In my journey, I'll be using C++. I'm using C++ simply to widen my arsenal of programming languages. With that being said, the language you use has no bearing on learning the fundamental concepts.</p>
