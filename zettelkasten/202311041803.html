        <p>The Categorical Imperative is, according to Immanuel Kant, a principle of practical rationality that is also the supreme principle of morality.</p>
        <h2 id="first-formulation">First Formulation</h2>
        <p><em>Act only in accordance with that maxim which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.</em></p>
        <p>Basically what's being said here is that you can claim an action is moral only if you would like everyone else to also do it.</p>
        <p><em>Example: Nobody wants their stuff stolen. If everyone stole, then, chances are, you would be stolen from. Stealing is therefore immoral.</em></p>
