        <p><strong>Collaborate with aircraft system engineers to develop test plans and procedures.</strong><br />
        I have experience working with our lead systems engineer responsible for verification of the full system (engine). I worked with him to define test objectives and identify the requirements we are verifying in our tests. Things often got messy since our test program was technically risk reduction as opposed to verification. When that happened, we'd schedule a meeting with our customers to get buy-off on our test program strategy.</p>
        <p><strong>Assist in coordination of integrated lab test scheduling.</strong><br />
        <strong>Support and/or execution of test procedures in integrated test labs.</strong><br />
        <strong>Support and/or creation of test data collection and reports.</strong><br />
        <strong>Development and maintenance of integrated test lab operating procedures.</strong></p>
        <p>At my last job, I did not have the opportunity to get direct hands-on experience with lab testing equipment, data collection, or operating procedures. The test facility personnel were responsible for operating their own equipment and conducting the test for us. My hands were full writing FRDs, SOWs, test plans, and test schematics for each of our integration tests.</p>
        <p>With that being said, in college, I designed, 3D-printed, and water-flow tested a protype rocket engine injector at 100 psi. I calibrated the pressure and flow sensors and and set up the data collection system myself, all using Arduino and my laptop.</p>
        <p>I created documentation by having conversations with team members and digging into our documentation. I hosted weekly meetings with the test facility, customer, and test facility and presented the current state of the plan for the test events as I had t hem, and asked questions to address any concerns I had.</p>
