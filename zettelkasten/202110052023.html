        <h2 id="what">What</h2>
        <p>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an approach to
        systems engineering [<a href="./202201080221.html">What is Systems
        Engineering?</a>] that is <em>model-based</em> as opposed to
        <em>document-based</em>.</p>
        <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
        <p>The problem with the document-based approach is that any
        change to the left side of the <a href="./202110032218.html">The Vee
        Model </a> must be updated across many documents manually.
        Furthermore, the impact of a change on the rest of the system
        requires thoughtful investigation, and could potentially result
        in design changes elsewhere.</p>
        <h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
        <p>On the other hand, a model-based approach propagates changes
        automatically, which streamlines iterative design. Additionally,
        the model serves as a <em>single source of truth</em> and data
        is an authoritative source of truth, thereby streamlining
        communication.</p>
        <p>MBSE supports quick iteration and delivers
        return-on-investment when change happens.</p>
