        <p>Funds in an HSA can be used to pay for any medical expenses approved by the IRS. Normally, health insurance premiums are not approved. However, the IRS has some conditions that qualify certain premiums to be HSA eligible:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Premiums paid for COBRA, Medicare, and long-term-care (chronic conditions) insurance may be eligible.</li>
        <li>You are unemployed and receive federal or state unemployment benefits or COBRA</li>
        </ul>
