        <p>William (Bill) Miller, INCODE FuSE Lead - Definition of systems engineering (SE):</p>
        <ol>
        <li>A determination for the objective to be reached.</li>
        <li>A thorough consideration of all factors that bear upon the possiblity of reaching that objective and the relationships among those factors.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>One could say that the purpose of the SE process is to find the optimal solution to a problem. But this is nearly impossible. We cannot automate this completely while arriving at an <em>objectively</em> optimal solution. Assumptions must be made in the face of unknowns/uncertainties and the stakeholders' needs and requirements must be carefully prioritized. Perfect models and simulations and hardcore calculated processes don't exist.</p>
        <p>The major problem industry faces is having a single source of truth that instantenously responds to change and communicates change. The reason we don't have this currently is simply be</p>
        <p>Modeling the people that interact with the system is just as important as the hardware/software components of the system. The people direct the trajectory of system design. People are influenced/controlled through policies. A great analogy here are IAM policies to control user permissions in relation to AWS resources.</p>
        <p>The Lifecycle Modeling Language is another modeling language aside from SysML v2, used by <a href="https://specinnovations.com/">SPEC Innovations</a>.</p>
