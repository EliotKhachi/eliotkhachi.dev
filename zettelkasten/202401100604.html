        <p><em>Fear setting</em> is an exercise popularized by Tim Ferris that is the writing and analysis of your fears in order to move past them into a particular change in your life. This could be quitting your job, ending your relationship, starting a relationship, having kids, going to a foreign country for 2 weeks, starting a business, ending your business, etc..</p>
        <p>The purpose of fear-setting is to help you make decisions in life that actually move you towards the life you want, yet these types of decisions are seldom made because of the comfort of the status-quo and because there is seemingly no good time to make the change.</p>
        <p><strong>How frequently should you fear-set?:</strong><br />
        Atleast once a quarter.<br />
        <strong>What should you write about?</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li>The costs and risks associated with the action you're considering taking.</li>
        <li>The costs and risks associated with inaction.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Write in great detail. Consider yourself and the people around you. Also write considering at different time scales; in 6 months, what will it cost you? How about a year? 2 years?</p>
