        to Supercharge Your Motivation For Your Goals</h1>
        <p>To supercharge your motivations for a goal you need to write
        them down.</p>
        <p>For each goal, break up your motivations for that goal into 3
        different parts: higher-self, day-to-day self, and lower-self
        motivations [<a href="./202402280215.html">Types of
        Motivations</a>].</p>
        <p>For each motivation, ask yourself:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What would achieving this goal do for you?</li>
        <li>How would you feel?</li>
        <li>How that would put you in an upward spiral/trajectory in
        life?</li>
        <li>What pain or suffering are you avoiding by achieving this
        goal?</li>
        <li>How would you feel if you couldn't avoid those things?</li>
        <li>How would that put you in a downward spiral/trajectory in
        life?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consider how your mental state, demeanor, and outlook on life
        would change, and the feedback loops therein.</p>
