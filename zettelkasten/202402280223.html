        <p>To superchage your motivation for a goal you need to define those motivations. What are your motivations for that goal and what are the things you are running away from by achieving that goal?</p>
        <p>For each of your goals, write down your motivations for it. Break up your motivations as stemming from 3 different parts of your self: your higher-self, day-to-day self, and lower-self [<a href="./202402280215.html">Types of Motivations</a>].</p>
        <p>For each motivation, flesh out what success would do for you, how it would make you feel, and how that would put you in an upward spiral/trajectory in life.</p>
        <p>Also flesh out what failure would do for you, how it would make you feel, and how that would put you in a downward spiral/trajectory in life.</p>
        <p>Consider how your mental state, overall demeanor, and outlook on life would change, and the feedback loops that result.</p>
