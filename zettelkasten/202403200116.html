        <p>The facility requirements document, sometimes referred to as the statement of work in the case of out-of-house test facilities, defines the capabilities needed by the test facility to successfully perform the test.</p>
        <p>It varies widely based on the system being tested, but generally speaking it specifies:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Facility interfaces and capabilities; i.e. can the facility provide sufficient power / fluid / data transfer speeds, etc, to perform the test and obtain the necessary data.</li>
        <li>Any test equipment necessary for installing the test article and performing the test, i.e. fixturing, data acquisition systems, power generators, pumps, etc.</li>
        <li>System safety concerns the facility ought to be aware of, and recommended precautions, i.e. PPE, but ultimate authority over safety guidelines and procedures are determined by the test facility.</li>
        <li>Data handling requirements for data downloads, transfers, and segregation of information (depends on the program's security guidelines, whether it be a classified test program or just proprietary)</li>
        </ol>
