        <p>This is a simple guide to back up your computer's root directory.</p>
        <h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-Requisites</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>An external disk: SD Card, microSD card, USB, SSD, HDD, etc. Make sure this has more storage space than the size of your root directory (<code>sudo du -sh /</code>) or main partition (<code>sudo fdisk -l</code>).</li>
        <li>A computer. This guide uses Ubuntu Linux OS.</li>
        <li>A secure connection between your disk and your computer. This can be physical or remote.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="steps-for-file-transfer">Steps For File Transfer</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Plug your external disk into your computer. Run <code>sudo fdisk -l</code> to find out what it's called. Let's suppose it is <code>/dev/sda1</code>.</li>
        <li>Format it to match the file system of your root partition. I'll be using "ext4"...<br />
        WARNING: THIS WILL WIPE YOUR EXTERNAL DISK: <code>sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1</code></li>
        <li>Mount the disk to a directory on your computer.<br />
        <code>sudo mkdir /mnt/backup &amp;&amp; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/backup</code></li>
        <li>Make sure the owner of the destination directory has read and write permissions.<br />
        <code>chmod 755 /mnt/backup</code></li>
        <li>Use the <code>rsync</code> command to copy your root directory. My script looks like this: <a href="https://github.com/EliotKhachi/scripts/blob/main/backupPC.sh">www.github.com/EliotKhachi/scripts/blob/main/backupPC.sh</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p><code>rsync</code> keeps track of files that changed and only transfers data as needed to sync directories. You can use <code>rsync</code> for remote transfers as well, i.e. <code>rsync -t my-files user@ip:destination-directory</code>. I recommend doing a local transfer first since it's much faster. You can then move the disk to a machine you have remote access to, such as a raspberry pi, and perform back-ups remotely from there.</p>
