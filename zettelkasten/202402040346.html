        <p>Agile software development is a project management approach that emphasizes small, fast product improvements and ultimately satisfying the customer rather than strictly following a plan or meeting requirements.</p>
        <h2 id="4-values">4 Values</h2>
        <p><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools<br />

        <strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</p>
        <p>Which is not to say that the items on the right have no value. The items on the left are simply valued more.</p>
