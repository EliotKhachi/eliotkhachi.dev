        <ul>
        <li>MBSE adoption is being encouraged by INCOSE, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the National Astronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</li>
        <li>The DOD released an instruction in December 2023 requiring the use of digital engineering methodologies across the lifecycle of defense acquisition programs <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500097p.PDF?ver=bePIqKXaLUTK_Iu5iTNREw%3d%3d">DOD Instruction 5000.97</a></li>
        <li>In addition to the aerospace industry, the automotive and medical industries are also beginning to adopt it.</li>
        <li>NASA has a vision for MBSE adoption within their organization by 2029. <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20210014025/downloads/TM-20210014025.pdf">Future MBSE Vision and Strategy Bridge for NASA</a></li>
        <li>The Object Management Group (OMG) published a beta specification for version 2 of their Systems Modeling Language, SysMLv2, in June 2023 [<a href="./202110032315.html">What is SysML?</a>], leading to a final adopted SysML v2 specification in 2024.</li>
        <li>The specification includes an open-source REST API and builds upon the expressiveness and versatility of SysML v1.</li>
        <li>SysmL v2 introduces for the first time a standardized <em>textual notation</em> for modeling systems, which makes it easier to build software around it.</li>
