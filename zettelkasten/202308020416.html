        <p>We all have encountered trauma to some degree in our lives, but we don't have to let it define us. Similarly, we aren't our jobs, status, nor our wealth.</p>
        <p>Then who are we? Who am I?</p>
        <p>I choose to identify as pure awareness and the spirit of transformation. I have the power to become whoever I want.</p>
