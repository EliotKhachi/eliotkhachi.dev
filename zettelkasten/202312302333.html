        <ol>
        <li>Founder-market fit? <em>Yes</em></li>
        <li>How big is the market? <em>Implementing model-based systems engineering and digital engineering practices is strongly recommended by the Department of Defense (DoD), and required by the DoD for some programs. It is also endorsed by NASA [3,4].</em></li>
        <li>How acute is this problem? <em>My company is implementing a 2-year plan to incorporate MBSE across the organization.</em></li>
        <li>Do you have competition and do you have a new insight? <em>Yes and yes. There are many competing MBSE tool vendors. My insight is that a model-based enterprise should be im plemented by software engineers rather than systems engineers. Tooling needs to be developed for software engineers so MBSE can really take off. An SDK gives them flexibility, control, and the power to build their own model-based enterprise (think of FAANG companies building their own internal tools).</em></li>
        <li>Do you want this? <em>As a systems engineer, yes. Information is disparate and constantly changing, making it unreliable. Reliable sources of information are the actual engineers, rather than the documents. I envision a model-based enterprise so robust that the information stored within the model is trusted over any engineer.</em></li>
        <li>Did this only recently become possible or necessary? <em>SysML v2 will soon be released which introduces a textual notation, making the language easier to work with as a software engineer. The textual notation is also great timing considering the advancement in LLM capabilities recently.</em></li>
        <li>Are there good proxies to this idea? <em>Good proxies to this idea are other IDEs, SDKs, frameworks, and libraries built for the purpose of accelerating software development. You could say that most s/w tools accelerate front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, while my idea is a tool for accelerating model development.</em></li>
        <li>Is this an idea you want to work on for years? <em>Yes. The future of model-based engineering is inevitable and limitless.</em></li>
        <li>Is this a scalable business? <em>Yes, this is software.</em></li>
        <li>Is this a good idea space? <em>Yes. MBSE can be applied to many industries, not just medical, automotive, or aerospace. There is still a LOT of work to be done in the MBSE space, so there are many options for pivoting. Afterall, the end goal is software that can read and understand customer requirements, generate architectural solutions, conduct trade studies, and arrive upon a fully articulated system/assembly for the customer through automated design and analysis.</em></li>
        </ol>
        <p>3 Things that make the idee seem bad but actually make it good:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Difficult or intimidating to get started.</li>
        <li>It's in a boring space.</li>
        <li>There are existing competitors.</li>
        </ol>
