        <ul>
        <li>"A part of a system is <em>anything</em> that costs the Program Manager money and the whole system is <em>everything</em> it takes to enable the mission to be performed." (Steven Dobbs)</li>
        <li>A system is an "integrated set of elements, subsystems or assemblies that accomplish a defined objective" (INCOSE).</li>
        <li>Anything man-made was created with a purpose, and can therefore be conceptualized as a system.</li>
        <li>"The functionality of a system is typically expressed in terms of the interactions of the system with its operating environment, especially the users."</li>
        </ul>
