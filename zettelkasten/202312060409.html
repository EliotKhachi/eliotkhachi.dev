        <p>The <em>sunk cost fallacy</em> is a psychological barrier that ties people to unsuccessful endeavors simply because they've committed resources to it. It's prevalent when management refuses to deviate from original plans even when those original plans fail to materialize. Emotions are often involved that cause irrational decision-making.</p>
