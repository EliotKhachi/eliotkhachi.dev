        <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are widely used security protocols with two functions:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Authentication and verification</li>
        <li>Data encryption (in-flight)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each TLS/SSL session consists of two keys:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>the public key used to encrypt the information (client-side)</li>
        <li>a corresponding private key is used to decrypt the information (server-side)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="types-of-certificates">Types of Certificates</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Self-signed - least secure</li>
        <li>Domain validated - checks that the SSL certificate is owned by the same person who owns the website's domain name</li>
        <li>Fully authenticated - Organization passed a # of validation procedures to confirm the existence of the business, ownership of the domain, and the user's authority to apply for the certificate</li>
        </ul>
