        <p>Often times, multiple <a
        href="../202312292240">transactions</a> occur simultaneously.
        <em>Isolation</em> ensures that the concurrent execution of
        transactions leaves the database in the same state that would
        have been obtained if the transactions were executed
        sequentially. Depending on the level of isolation level used,
        the effects of an incomplete transaction might not be visible to
        other transactions.</p>
