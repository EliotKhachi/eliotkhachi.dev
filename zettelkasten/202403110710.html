        <p>RDS read replicas are used to scale your application's capabilities to read from your RDS database.</p>
        <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>You can create up to 15 read replicas in your cluster, within an AZ, across AZs, and even across regions!!! Make sure to update your application's connection to them.</li>
        <li>Read replicas replicate the write instance asyncronously (eventually consistent)</li>
        <li>Read replicas can be promoted to their own DB</li>
        <li>Can be set up as a Multi AZ Disaster Recovery RDS instance (synchronous replication &amp; no longer accepts reads at that point)</li>
        </ul>
